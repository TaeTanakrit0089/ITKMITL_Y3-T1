## Module 01: Knowledge Check

1. **Question Title:** What are the advantages of cloud computing over computing on-premises? (Select the best answer.)

   **Correct Answer:** All of the above

   **Explanation:** Cloud computing provides many advantages over on-premises computing, including avoiding large
   capital
   purchases, using on-demand capacity, going global in minutes, and increasing speed and agility. Therefore, "All of
   the
   above" is the correct answer.

2. **Question Title:** What is the pricing model that enables AWS customers to pay for resources on an as-needed
   basis? (Select the best answer.)

   **Correct Answer:** Pay as you go

   **Explanation:** The "Pay as you go" pricing model is commonly used by AWS and other cloud providers. It allows
   customers to pay only for the resources they actually use, on an hourly or per-second basis. This provides
   flexibility and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional on-premises models.
3. **Question Title:** Which of these is NOT a cloud computing model? (Select the best answer.)

   **Correct Answer:** System administration as a service

   **Explanation:** The standard cloud computing models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (
   PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  "System administration as a service" is not a recognized cloud computing
   model. While system administration can be managed in the cloud, it's not a distinct model like the other three.
4. **Question Title:** True or False? AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for application
   services, while you provision and use what you need.

   **Correct Answer:** True

   **Explanation:** The statement is true. AWS, like other cloud providers, owns and manages the underlying
   infrastructure, including the servers, networking equipment, and data centers. Users don't need to buy or maintain
   this hardware. They only provision and use the resources they need, paying for them on an as-needed basis.
5. **Question Title:** Which of these is NOT a benefit of cloud computing over on-premises computing? (Select the best
   answer.)

   **Correct Answer:** Pay for racking, stacking, and powering servers

   **Explanation:** The benefit of cloud computing is that you **don't** have to pay for racking, stacking, and powering
   servers. Those are things that are handled by the cloud provider. The other options are all genuine benefits of cloud
   computing.

6. **Question Title:** Which of the following are NOT benefits of AWS Cloud computing? (Choose two.)

   **Correct Answer:** Multiple procurement cycles, High latency

   **Explanation:**

    - **Multiple procurement cycles** is a negative aspect of on-premises computing. Cloud computing simplifies
      procurement, often requiring a single contract and payment method.

    - **High latency** is not a benefit of cloud computing. Cloud services are designed to minimize latency and provide
      fast
      responses.
    - The other options are benefits:
        - **High availability** is a key feature of cloud platforms, ensuring applications and services stay
          operational.
        - **Temporary and disposable resources** allow for cost savings and flexibility by provisioning resources only
          when
          needed.
        - **Fault-tolerant databases** ensure data durability and protection from failures.


7. **Question Title:** Which of the following is a compute service? (Select the best answer)

   **Correct Answer:** Amazon EC2

   **Explanation:**

    - **Amazon EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud) is AWS's core compute service. It provides virtual servers (instances) that
      users can provision and use for various workloads.
    - **Amazon VPC** is a virtual private cloud service that allows users to create isolated and secure networks in the
      AWS cloud.
    - **Amazon S3** is a storage service for objects, like files and images.
    - **Amazon CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) service that speeds up content delivery to users.
    - **Amazon Redshift** is a data warehousing service for analyzing large datasets.


8. **Question Title:** True or False? Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a
   broad set of application services over the internet. You own the network-connected hardware required for these
   services and Amazon Web Services provisions what you need.

   **Correct Answer:** False

   **Explanation:** The statement is false. The core principle of cloud computing is that you **don't** own the
   underlying hardware. Cloud providers, like AWS, own and maintain the servers, storage, and networking infrastructure.
   You access and use these resources over the internet, paying for what you use.


9. **Question Title:** Economies of scale result from _______. (Select the best answer.)

   **Correct Answer:** having hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud

   **Explanation:**

    - **Economies of scale** occur when the cost per unit of production decreases as the volume of production increases.
      In cloud computing, this happens because cloud providers serve a massive number of customers. By sharing
      infrastructure and resources among many users, they can lower costs and offer more affordable services.

   The other options are not directly related to economies of scale:

    - **Having many different cloud providers** suggests competition, not a single entity benefiting from scale.
    - **Having hundreds of cloud services available over the internet** describes the variety of offerings, not the core
      principle of economies of scale.
    - **Having to invest heavily in data centers and servers** is a cost factor, not a driver of economies of scale.

10. **Question Title:** Which of these are ways to access AWS core services? (Choose three.)

    **Correct Answer:** AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Software Development Kits (SDKs)

    **Explanation:**

    - **AWS Management Console** is the web-based interface for managing AWS services. It provides a user-friendly way
      to interact with various services.
    - **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)** allows users to manage AWS services from the command line, useful for
      scripting and automation.
    - **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** provide libraries and tools that simplify the integration of AWS services
      into applications.

    The other options are not ways to directly access core services:

    - **Technical support calls** are for help and troubleshooting, not for accessing services.
    - **AWS Marketplace** offers third-party software and services, not core AWS services themselves.
