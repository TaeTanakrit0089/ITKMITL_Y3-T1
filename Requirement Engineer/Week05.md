## Analyze the Problem: Activities and Artifacts

## Problem Analysis

* **What is it?**
    - The process of understanding real-world problems, user's needs, and proposing solutions to meet those needs.
* **What is the goal?**
    - Gain a better understanding before development begins
    - Identify root causes
    - Help formulate the business requirements
    - Help find the right solution

## Why Is Analyzing the Problem Important?

* To:
    - Avoid the “Yes…but…”
    - Minimize extra work
    - Understand requirements
    - To find the right solution

**What is the problem really?**

*(This section appears to be missing content in the original document.)*

## Definition of a Problem

“A problem can be defined as the **Difference between things as perceived and things as desired”**

*(This section appears to be missing content in the original document.)*

## Problem Analysis Activities

* Gain agreement on the problem definition
* Understand the root causes
* Define the business requirements
* Identify the correct solution
* Identify stakeholders
* Define the solution system boundary
* Identify constraints on the system or project

## Gain Agreement

* **What is the problem?**
    - Understand customer’s perspective
    - Document customer perspective
    - Gain agreement on it
* **What is the problem, Really?**
    - Search for root causes
    - Address the root causes

## What Is the Problem Behind the Problem?

**Fishbone Diagram: One method for Root-Cause Analysis**

* List contributing causes to the identified problem.
* Keep asking “Why?” (expand each rib).
* How much does each contribute?

*(This section appears to be missing content in the original document.)*

## Focus on the Largest Contributors

**Pareto Diagram**

* Rank in order and use the 80-20 Rule to focus on the top contributing causes to address the greatest portion of the
  problem.

## Exercise 4.1: The Problem Behind the Problem

* Discuss the class project
* Identify and weight root causes
    - Fishbone diagram
    - Pareto diagram

## Formulate the Business Requirements

* Business requirements should address the root causes
* Specify the current situation
* Specify the desired business situation
* Be measurable

## Identify the Business Solution

* Analyze the business requirements
* Identify a number of solutions
    - Technical or non-technical, or both
* Choose the one(s) that best meet the business requirements
* Start a project to implement the solution

## Business Models

* Model organization structure and dynamics
    * Business processes
    * Products
    * Organization structure
    * Deliveries
    * Role and responsibilities
    * Events
* Visualize the organization and its processes
* Help understand current problems

* Derive and validate system requirements needed to support the organization

## Business Use-Case Model

* **Business actor:**
    - Someone or something outside the business that interacts with the business.
* **Business use case:**
    - A sequence of actions a business performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular business
      actor.

* Help prevent misunderstandings
* Capture common vocabulary
    * Start as soon as possible
    * Continue throughout the projects

## Artifacts: Focus on Vision

*(This section appears to be missing content in the original document.)*

## Vision Document

* Communicate between management, marketing, and the project team

* Establish scope and priority of high-level features

**A document that gets “all parties working from the same book.”**

## Vision Document (cont.)

* System-level document that describes the “What” and “Why” of the product or application
* Focus:
    - User needs
    - Goals and objectives
    - Target markets
    - User environments and platforms
    - Product features

## Formulating the Problem Statement

**Problem Statement**

* The problem of (describe the problem)
* Affects (the stakeholders affected by the problem)
* The impact of which is (what is the impact of the problem)
* A successful solution would (like some key business benefits of a successful solution)

## Exercise 4.2: Analyze the Problem

* Formulate the business requirements
* Identify the right solution
* Start Vision
    - Identify project stakeholders
    - Identify constraints on the project
    - Formulate a problem statement
* Find actors and system boundaries

## Sample Solution: Identify Stakeholders

* Trading Customers
* HelloWorld company
    - Board of directors
    - Marketing Dept.
    - Engineering Dept.
    - Tech support
    - Developers

## Sample Solution: Identify Actors and Boundaries

*(This section appears to be missing content in the original document.)*

## Sample Solution: Identify Constraints

* Tax laws
* Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules
* Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
* Project schedule
* Project budget
* Security for financial information
* Legacy interfaces
* Web-based interface constraints

## Sample Solution: Problem Statement

The problem of **HelloWorld Company losing customers at a rate of 100 per month**

Affects **HelloWorld Company**

The impact of which is **Loss of revenue and profitability for HelloWorld Company**

A successful solution would

* allow customers to trade at any time
* ensure that callers could get through to telephone operators
* reduce the trading fees
* not increase the operating costs for HelloWorld Company

## Develop Requirements Management Plan

* **What is in a Requirements Management Plan?**
    - Types of requirements to collect
    - Types of attributes to track
    - Types of requirements to trace
    - Types of documents to produce
    - Management guidelines

## Sample Requirement Attributes

| Attribute          | Description                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rationale          | Reason for the requirement                                         |

## Organizing Project Artifacts

* Develop or adopt standard templates
* Record your standards in RM Plan
* **Benefits of standardization:**
    - Leverage the work of others
    - Quick start, avoid reinventing the wheel
    - Make sure things don’t fall through the cracks
    - Centralize information
    - Consistency in documents
        * Appear familiar and not intimidating
        * Are easier to read

## What Artifacts Are Used to Manage Requirements?

* Where do we document our requirements process?
* Where do we list the stakeholders and users?
* Where do we define the problem?
* Where do we maintain the use cases?
* Where do we identify the environments and platforms?
* Where do we maintain common terminology?

| Artifact | Description |

| RM Plan  |             |
| Vision   |             |
| UC Specs |             |
